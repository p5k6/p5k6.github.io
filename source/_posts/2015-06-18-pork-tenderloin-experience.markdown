### I've been watching Good Eats a bit of late

There's a handful of episodes on Netflix now. So - I tried [one of Alton Brown's pork tenderloin recipes yesterday](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/grilled-pork-tenderloin-recipe.html). 
But - I wasn't quite sure what to serve as a side. 
In the past, I've been partial to pineapple (love some grilled pineapple!).
However, I also had some leftover rice in the rice cooker, still hot from the previous day.

So - I tried something a little different. I added the rice to a mixing bowl, then added the reserved marinade from *after* post-grill marinating of the pork, to the rice. 
I then took about 1/2 of the grilled pineapple and cut them into chunks, adding them to the rice mixture.

I personally really enjoyed the meal. The pineapple adds a sweetness that offsets the strong sour flavor from the lime. 
There was also enough salt in the leftover marinade for me; this is something that would be easy to overlook though. 
I wouldn't be afraid to add additional salt if I felt it necessary.
The rice was a bit strong by itself (it's quite sour - the pineapple *really* is necessary, err on adding more pineapple than you think you need).

For dinner, I served the rice/pineapple/marinade mix separately; however, for leftovers, I chopped up some leftover pork and added it to the rice mix (as it is a nice addition to the rice mix).

### Pineapple/Pork marinade rice side recipe (makes about 4 servings)

###### Ingredients
* leftover marinade from pork tenderloin (the half used to marinate *after* grilling the tenderloin)
* about 3 cups cooked rice (probably could have used a little more, as the marinade is quite strong)
* about 1/2 of a grilled pineapple, cut into bite size chunks

###### Directions
* Mix all of the above together in a mixing bowl right before serving

### Notes
* **Do not use the marinade used with the raw pork**
* I served with a slice of pork tenderloin, and the rest of the pineapple as a second side
* I might experiment with using *all* of the pineapple in the rice bowl in the future
* Trying 4-6 cups cooked rice, whole pineapple and the marinade might be a good idea
* Reheats decently in the microwave; not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst (in terms of "how good reheated is" vs "how good original was")
