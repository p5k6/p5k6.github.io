### I love burritos

And I always have. They're quick and delicious, though maybe not the healthiest thing in the world. 
Years ago I came across a recipe which has become a staple of my diet for about a decade now.
Combine this with a rice cooker and you have a very hands-off way to cook up a big meal.

This recipe makes about 2.5 pounds of shredded chicken, which is great for adding to burritos, tacos and other items.
I believe I got this recipe from the old Ars Technica Bachelor Chow pdf that was sent around their forums a long time ago, though I could be mistaken there (I've since lost the pdf).

### Chicken filling Recipe

###### Ingredients
* 1 2 1/2 pound bag of frozen chicken breasts (you can get these at most grocery stores).
  * defrost the chicken breasts overnight for best results
* 1 24 oz jar of salsa (I prefer a medium strength one)
* 1 packet of taco seasoning

###### Equipment
* 1 slow cooker (I've used 4 and 6.5 quart ones; think the 4 qt one works better, though 6.5 works quite well)

###### Directions
* put the defrosted chicken, taco seasoning and salsa in the slow cooker
* cook for 8-10 hours on low
* shred the chicken
* integrate some of the leftover salsa into the shredded chicken for best taste

### Notes
* I've used 16 oz jars of salsa in the past (more common than 24 oz jars). Personally I find 16 oz is not enough to cover the chicken, or add enough flavor. They work better in 4 qt slow cookers if you want to use this size though
* According to [this site](http://www.stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/16787) cooked chicken will last 3-4 days before going bad, so use it up before then
* I usually put a small amount (couple of forkfulls) in a container when reheating, and reheat for 1m30s
* I live at high altitude (5430 feet); [supposedly I should be adjusting my slow cooking for this](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/p41.html#slow)
* If you don't defrost the chicken ahead of time, a lot of the chicken juice will end up in the slow cooker, watering down the salsa
